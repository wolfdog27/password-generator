# password-generator

We need to create a password generator from prompts.  

This was more challenging than I was hoping... but let's keep trying!  Sorry for the late turn in.  But I'm glad I understand all the functions now =)

Based on user-input, we create a password from 8-128 characters using or not using four combinations: upper case letter, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.

we then create a loop to return a password to the client.
